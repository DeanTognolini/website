NetFlow is used to collect information about traffic flows in your environment, this information can be exported to a NetFlow analyzer which converts the raw data into human readable formats such as graphs, charts and tables. It is possible to configure NetFlow as a standalone feature on a network device and view the flow information from the local cache.

A network flow is a stream of packets between a source and destination that share the following matching fields in the IP header:

* Source IP
* Destination IP
* Source Port
* Destination Port
* Layer 3 Protocol Type
* Type of Service
* Input Interface

If any of these fields are different, it is a different flow.

When NetFlow is configured on a network device, the flow information is stored in a NetFlow cache entry in the local cache, an entry exists for each flow. When the flow expires the information is exported to a NetFlow collector if configured to do so, otherwise it is deleted.

# Configuring NetFlow
To configure NetFlow we must identify the interface where flows should be captured and enable NetFlow on that interface in either the ingress or egress direction.

To enable NetFlow on an interface the `ip flow [ ingress / egress ]` command is used.

```
R1(config)#int gi0/1.100
R1(config-if)#ip flow ingress 
R1(config-if)#end
```

To create some traffic for NetFlow to record I will send five pings from PC1 to PC2, the pings will be ingress on R1â€™s Gi0/1.100 sub-interface where NetFlow is enabled.
```
PC1> ping 192.168.200.10 
84 bytes from 192.168.200.10 icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=5.861 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.200.10 icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=2.876 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.200.10 icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=3.481 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.200.10 icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=2.829 ms
84 bytes from 192.168.200.10 icmp_seq=5 ttl=63 time=3.247 ms
```

# Viewing NetFlow Information
To view NetFlow information stored in the local cache the `show ip cache flow` command is used.

In the below output we can see there is 1 active flow, which is the pings from PC1 to PC2. NetFlow will hold onto information for inactive flows for 15 seconds, this timeout value can be see in the below output, if this command is ran within that time we can see information about the active flow at the bottom of the output. After 15 seconds this information will be deleted and added to the statistics table as shown in the second example of output, where we can see our 5 ICMP packets.

# Clearing NetFlow Information
To clear NetFlow information stored in the local cache the clear ip flow stats command is used.

```
R1#clear ip flow stats
