      <description>&amp;ndash;
The Issue I had an issue on a recent project where I had a WGB-client directly connected to Gi0 on a Cisco IW3702 WGB that I wanted to be in VLAN200 so I configured the workgroup-bridge client-vlan 200 command, therefore the MAC address for this WGB-client should be in bridge-group 200 (BG200).</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash;
debug dot11 &amp;lt;radio_interface&amp;gt; trace print rates is a pretty cool command you can use to show debugging information related to the dynamic changing of WIFI MCS rates.
Below is an output from one of my lab APs while running this debug, the drop to M6 and M7 data rates is when I put a metal pot over the top of one of the APs!</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash;
The debug dot11 &amp;lt;radio_interface&amp;gt; trace print uplink command can be used to see detailed information on what the radio interface is doing while looking for a parent.
The below shows the output from a WGB client AP when it lost its parent AP.</description>

These Cisco WGB configurations enable support for WGB-clients in different VLANs.
In this deployment I have two VLANs:
VLAN100 is for device management such as the AP BVI interfaces.</description>
